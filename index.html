            <h2>A Breakdown of Ten common Git Commands</h2>
        
            <p> <strong>Git add</strong> <br>
Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.
<br><br>

<strong>Git branch</strong> <br>
This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. It lets you create isolated development environments within a single repository. <br>
<br>

<strong>Git checkout</strong> <br>
In addition to checking out old commits and old file revisions, git checkout is also the means to navigate existing branches. Combined with the basic Git commands, it is a way to work on a particular line of development.
<br><br>

<strong>Git clean</strong> <br>
Removes untracked files from the working directory. This is the logical counterpart to git reset, which (typically) only operates on tracked files. <br>
<br>

<strong>Git clone</strong> <br>
Creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is the most common way for developers to obtain a working copy of a central repository. <br>
<br>

<strong>Git commit</strong> <br>
Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users. <br>
<br>

<strong>Git commit --amend</strong> <br>
Passing the --amend flag to git commit lets you amend the most recent commit. This is very useful when you forget to stage a file or omit important information from the commit message. <br>
<br>

<strong>Git config</strong> <br>
A convenient way to set configuration options for your Git installation. Youâ€™ll typically only need to use this immediately after installing Git on a new development machine. <br>
<br>

<strong>Git fetch</strong> <br>
Fetching downloads a branch from another repository, along with all of its associated commits and files. But, it doesn't try to integrate anything into your local repository. This gives you a chance to inspect changes before merging them with your project. <br>
<br>

<strong>Git init</strong> <br>
Initializes a new Git repository. If you want to place a project under revision control, this is the first command you need to learn. <br>
